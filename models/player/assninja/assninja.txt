ASSNinja Clan skin by Michael Patrick Clark, aka Sigma-X. Sigmax01@aol.com

Place files in the valve\models\player\assninja found in the Half Life folder.  The folder needs 
to be named the same as the model, or it won't work right.

This is my 3rd skin for Half Life, and is a modified Gordon, wearing a balc jumpsuit, with colored kneepad things, and the ass logo on front and back.  He also has these big white cartoony eyes.  he looks pretty spiffy, although I coulda worked on the shading a bit.  He's based on a drawing made entriely with sine and cosine waves, see if you can duplicate it!
